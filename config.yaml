  # Humanization level represents the level at which bot attempts to simulate human behaviour
  # At 0 level (always on) it will only have minimal delays to prevent spamming and getting banned
  # At 1st level (default) it will retrieve message content and wait estimated reading time
  # At 2nd level it will emulate "sessions" of activity, limiting the number of actions per login
  # At 3rd level it will emulate day-cycle, introducing more smart level of "session" creating via different lifestyles
